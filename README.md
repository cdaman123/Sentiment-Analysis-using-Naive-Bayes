**Naive bayes is an algorithm that could be used for sentiment analysis. It takes a short time to train and also has a short prediction time.** We will be using Naive Bayes for sentiment analysis on tweets. Given a tweet, we will decide if it has a positive sentiment or a negative one. We will be using a data set of tweets.The twitter_samples contains subsets of 5,000 positive tweets, 5,000 negative tweets.we split dataset in Train test split , 20% will be in the test set, and 80% in the training set. 


We can devide this Project in below parts:
* Part 0 : Load Data
* Part 1 : Process the Data
* Part 2 : Train model using Naive Bayes
* Part 3 : Test naive bayes
* Part 4 : Filter words by Ratio of positive to negative counts
* Part 5 : Error Analysis
* Part 6 : Predict with custom tweet

We implement Nevia Bayes algorithm From Scretch in this project, and get **accurecy 99.40%** in the used dataset.
